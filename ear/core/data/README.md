## Design_5200_100_random.dat

Approximate spherical t-design for t=100, as in [0].

"The text file for each point set consists of two columns which contain the
spherical coordinates (phi,theta) in [0,2pi] x [0,pi) of the quadrature points
p = ( sin(theta) * cos(phi), sin(theta) * sin(phi), cos(theta))."
